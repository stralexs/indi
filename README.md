## Concept
### Problem: how to make a person with 0-level English knowledge a native speaker?
"indi" is an application that will allow the user to "grow up" as a native speaker. The application offers a new approach to learning a foreign language, which relies on the formation of speech
and intellect of a native speaker according to the stages of human life: from infancy to maturity.
